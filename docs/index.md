## Hello, my name is Shelton, and this is my personal website for EGR 314.

### My Subsystem  

My subsystem is the two-way internet connection using the built-in Wi-Fi functionality of the WROOM ESP32.  
This subsystem will communicate with an MQTT server, gathering data from other sensors and posting it to a user’s phone, as well as sending values to a user interface screen.
