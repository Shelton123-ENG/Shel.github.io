I defined the pinouts on the ribbon connectors, as well as the RX and TX blocks to communicate with other systems in the daisy chain. The arrow directions were also changed to their correct orientations to denote which way power and signals are being sent. Lastly, part numbers were added to each block symbolizing what components need to be soldered on the physical PCB as well.
